This module defines the game logic and core entities for the 2D shooting game.
It includes classes for Player, Alien, Bullet, and the central Model that manages state.

Classes:
    Player: Represents a player character with movement and shooting abilities.
    Alien: Represents an enemy that moves and can collide with players.
    Bullet: Represents a projectile shot by a player.
    Model: Represents the game state and contains update logic.
